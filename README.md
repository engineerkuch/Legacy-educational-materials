# Legacy-educational-materials

/*
These are some of the materials I could recover from my mining engineering and mine survey educational hard drive. 

Most of these xls sheets were visualized and further analyzed using several tools (i.e. QGIS, k-mine, Civil3D, ...).

As time does on, I'll update some of them using modern tools.
